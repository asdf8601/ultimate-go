## Quotes


- The hardest bugs are those where your mental model of the situation is just
  wrong, so you can't see the problem at all. - Brian Kernighan
- Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the
  first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will
  you ever debug it? - Brian Kernighan
- We do never guess, when guessing you gonna be wrong. - Bill Kennedy
